  <h1 id=header> Dancing with Alyssa<br><small> Get it l-like Dancing with the Stars... No... Ok.. lol ok Continue</small></h1>
<em><center><font size="5"> This is the dance group I run at school we are relativly new still so please show us support, the name is Mono as you can tell from the instagram page phot I placed below. The goal we have as a group is to insprired those around us by dancing to Hip Hop and K-pop. A there manager I tend to pick the songs and choreography for them to perform. I also learn some of the K-pop dances in advance to tech them due to them having to go home early sometimes after class. If you'd like to see me dance I'd gladly show you a song or two lol. Anyway I just never got the experience to be able to enjoy dancing at school due to it being so based on academics, so I wanted to provide them with a foundation before I graduate. :)</font></em> <img src="IMG_0746.jpg">
